# clipboard-landing-page

Just started using multiple scss files, its awesome! This challenge was fun and was worth the time for it.

Remarks:
 - making images responsive using max-width and resizing with padding (scss line 157)
 - text-aligning auto-centered grid items into initial (scss line 269)
